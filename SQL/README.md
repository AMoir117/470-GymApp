# Notes

* DailyRoutine id could potentially be removed

* "CONSTRAINT OneWayRelationship CHECK (ID1 < ID2)," doesnt actually do anything with newer versions of MySQL, but it should still hold the OneWayRelationship with the unique key CONSTRAINT

* TODO:

* use the name "GymAppDB" as your database name
