# Notes

* DailyRoutine id could potentially be removed

* "CONSTRAINT OneWayRelationship CHECK (ID1 < ID2)," doesnt actually do anything with newer versions of MySQL, but it should still hold the OneWayRelationship with the unique key CONSTRAINT

* SQL Inserts are at the bottom of db_schema.sql

* use the name "GymAppDB" as your database name


* TODO:

* change friends table to followers
